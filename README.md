# VCNL4040

The [VCNL4040](https://www.vishay.com/en/product/84274/) is a fully integrated Proximity and Ambient Light Sensor With Infrared Emitter, I2C Interface, and Interrupt Function.

This crate provides an asynchronous driver for the VCNL4040. This code was primarily developed for use on the BeagleBone Green system with minimal functionality requirements; you can select which functionality to initialize at the beginning. Therefore, expect some parts of the code to be untested.
